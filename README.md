# AI-Powered Cloud Cost Optimizer

An AI-driven CLI tool that analyzes cloud project descriptions, simulates cloud billing,
and generates cost optimization recommendations using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This project is designed for early-stage cloud cost planning, FinOps learning,
and architectural cost analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Natural language project description input
- AI-based project profile extraction
- Synthetic cloud billing generation (6–15 records)
- Cost analysis with budget comparison
- Optimization recommendations with:
  - Estimated savings
  - Risks
  - Open-source alternatives
  - Multi-cloud options
- Rich CLI-based user interface

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namanjain2302/cloud-cost-optimizer
cd cloud-cost-optimizer
```

2️⃣ Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```
3️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4️⃣ Configure environment variables

Create a .env file using the example:
```bash

cp .env.example .env
```
Add your Hugging Face API key inside .env.

▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🤖 AI Usage & Academic Integrity

AI tools were used in this project **strictly as learning and productivity aids**, and **not as substitutes for independent understanding, design decisions, or authorship**. All core logic, implementation choices, and final code were written, reviewed, and fully understood by the author.

### Tools Used

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
  Used for:
  - Clarifying system design approaches for LLM-based pipelines  
  - Debugging JSON parsing, API integration, and error-handling scenarios  
  - Refining validation logic, CLI flow, and overall code structure  

- **Perplexity AI**  
  Used for:
  - Verifying best practices related to Hugging Face Inference APIs  
  - Cross-checking model compatibility, request formats, and response constraints  

All AI-assisted suggestions were **selectively applied, adapted, and validated** to ensure correctness, originality, and compliance with academic integrity guidelines.
