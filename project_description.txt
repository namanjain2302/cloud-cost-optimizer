We are building a live video streaming platform similar to Twitch. The backend is built using Go (Golang) microservices for high concurrency. We use Apache Kafka for 
real-time data streaming and Cassandra for storing chat messages and user logs. The infrastructure will be deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in the GCP Mumbai 
region. We also need a CDN for video delivery. Our estimated monthly budget is 60,000 INR.
